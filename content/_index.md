My name is Elijah and I am making a game with my very talented friend [Sam][sam].

That game is about trees, contemplation, and whimsey -- but it is an early work in progress.

when I get around to finishing that project -- or anything for that matter -- I'll post about it here!

You might be here because I write those games in [Rust][rust] with [Bevy][bevy] and I love to share [technical thoughts](/tags/rust).
