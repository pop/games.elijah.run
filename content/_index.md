My name is Elijah and I program videogames with my very talented friend and artist [Sam][sam].

If you are interested in playing those games, check out my [itch.io][itch] page.

My most recent game is called [Martian Chess][martianchess], based on the board game of the same name.

You might be here because I write those games in [Rust][rust] with [Bevy][bevy] and I love to share [technical thoughts](/tags/rust).
