This month I finished a few games on my backlog and read some books.

## Half Life: Alyx

I bought an [HTC Vive][vive] in 2018 when I upgraded my PC.
I tried some games, but the headset spent the better part of the next 4 years gathering dust.

Half Life Alyx is easily the best VR game I have ever played.
The controls are fluid, the gameplay is fun, and the story is compelling and meshes will with the VR experience.
Others have talked about how excellent HL: Alyx, so I won't try to top them here.

As for the topic of VR in general, I would summarize it like this: I am glad to have VR experiences available, but I still prefer input + monitor gaming over the VR experience.

VR is interesting in that it is one of the few mediums that demands your complete attention by literally surrounding you in the experience.
This is fun to play with but I only want to relinquish myself to media in that way from time to time, not as the default.
For that reason I hope VR continues to be a niche but powerful technology, like at-home espresso machines or trampolines: fun but not something everybody needs own.

## Kentucky Route Zero

## Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate

I bought [Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate][strongbad] for a friend for Christmas and we had a blast streaming it over Discord.

If you are a fan of Homestarrunner you will enjoy this short game.
