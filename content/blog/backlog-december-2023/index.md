# Backlog: Origins

As usually happens when I have time off, I was staring at my bookshelves and lamenting the sheer volume of books I own but have not read.
Looking at volume after volume of graphic novel, sci-fi adventure, and technical tome I could feel anxiety as I was worried I may _never_ read these books and I should just give up now.

To distract myself from the scary no-no thoughts I turned on my Steam Deck to play a game -- but which one?
Scrolling through my digital library the feeling returned now turned up to 11 because somehow I have even more games than books.
Page after page of games I have had "on my list" for years, and even more I will certainly never get around to.

I slid my Steam Deck away in anguish and turned to my media comfort food: YouTube.
There I found that [Daryl Talks Games (DTG) posted a follow-up to his "Games Backlog" video][dtg]; after 1 year he finally finished his backlog!
I watched admiring his follow-through, and appreciating that he shared his rule-bending instead of claiming that he had achieved the impossible.

In that video DTG included some interesting tidbits:
1. The goal of the backlog is to find new experiences, not to "check everything off the list".
2. If something is not bringing you joy, move on.
3. Have a spreadsheet.

These three points completely transformed how I thought about the concept of "a backlog".
Despite having spreadsheets for everything from apartment finding to job searching I had never thought to spreadsheet my backlog.
And I had always struggled to start a piece of media I knew would fail to finish -- who has time for 100 hour RPGs?

I looked up from my phone back to my bookshelf and then to my Deck.
Invigorated, I resolved to tackle my backlog; not in the new year but starting this week!
I wouldn't "check everything off" but I would make an effort to chew on things I wouldn't normally and "check things off" that I had started.

Unlike DTG's video focused on games[^1] this be a "mega backlog" stating with Books, Graphic Novels, and Games[^2].
With a few rules in place:

1. Triage. Don't start something you're not _a little_ excited about.
2. Give it a real try. Read 50 pages/play 10 hours before giving up on anything.
3. Minimize "fun in progress". Once you start a thing try to finish it before picking something else up.

So I cracked open Notion and started a database[^3] of every book on my shelves.
I tried scanning the barcodes, which often contain ISBNs, but had a difficult time finding an API which could report accurate info[^4].

I then moved on to games which thanks to [this thread][thread] I used [this site][export] to export my list of games[^5].
It turns out I have 500+ games on Steam thanks to over a decade on the platform and a _lot_ of Humble Bundles.

Next I triaged the list sorting out games and books I had no intention of reading/playing.
I also sorted games/books I had already completed, which was ~10%!

## Slay the Spire

[Slay the Spire][spire] is a roguelike card battler in which you fight your way through enemies, gamble on random encounters, and battle bosses.

I am very bad at Slay the Spire, but I did play at least 10 hours!
I would love to keep playing, but the skill ceiling is very high and my time is fleeting.
It feels like the kind of game you can spend 100+ hours on[^6] and still find depth to explore.
And frankly I do not have that kind of time -- the backlog calls to me!

## Into the Breach

[Into the Breach][breach] is a turn-based strategy game where you fight big ol bugs as a bunch of mechs with some weird moves.

I am very bad at Into the Breach, but I have put in 10 hours and really like it!
This is *also* the kind of game I think you could spend 1000 hours playing with rich mechanics and challenges after every hurdle.

I am happy with myself for struggling with this game at first and powering through to "start to get it".
Before this exercise turn-based strategy games felt impenetrable but now they just feel really hard!

## Stacklands

[Stacklands][stack] is a survival card battler where you collect/spend resources, craft items, and fight enemies.

This game is really cute and the card mechanics are a fun way to quantize the experience of a survival+crafting game like Minecraft or [Valheim][valheim].
This made games much easier to start, play, and wipe without feeling like I had lost literally 10's of hours of playtime.
After ~5 hours I feel ready to put it away; I haven't beaten the final boss or anything but my excitement is waning.

I used to support the developer of this game, [SockPop][sockpop], on Patreon but cancelled never playing the games they put out every month.
I was happy to finally give one of their published games the time it deserves.

## Books

I also ready some books this month:
* [Artificial Intelligence: a Guide for Thinking Humans](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20666330W/) on Audiobook from my Library. A grounded introduction to AI; welcomed amidst the hype train.
* [The Go-Giver](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15009577W/) on Audiobook by my manager's suggestion. I am weirdly fascinated by "business self-help books" of which this is a pretty solid one.
* [The Girl with all the Gifts](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17038327W/) on audiobook. Inventive zombie story.
* [Greenwood](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20649376W/Greenwood) on Audiobook as well. Compelling generational story.

... none of which were on the backlog to start with, so the list isn't getting shorter.
I'm planning to chew through a few books on the shelf next month.

[^1]: It's a gaming channel so it would be weird to include movies, books, etc in his list.
[^2]: While I have TV and Movies I want to watch I have nowhere near the same guilt about them as I do with books and games.
[^3]: I like Notion for this because Databases can act as Spreadsheets as well as Kanban boards tracking "todo"/"in-progress"/"done".
[^4]: Archive.org has a database I had some success with, but it resolved one of my ISBNs as a Caillou kids book, so it could not be trusted for a bulk "process all of these ISBNs into my spreadsheet" task.
[^5]: My only gripe was that it sorted genres in some sort of CSV bitfield with each genre being a column and an "X" designating if that game had the genre in question, making it tedious to massage into my Notion Database.
[^6]: I just checked and my best friend, who is really into Slay the Spire, reportedly has 588 hours logged. Wowza.
